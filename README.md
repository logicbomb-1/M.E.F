# Misconfigured Endpoint Finder (M.E.F)

This is M.E.F, a python project to detect exposed misconfigured enpoint in the given list of domains along with performing port scanning against critical ports. It scans the domains to get their subdomains using subfinder and port scans them and find misconfigured enpoints in all of the subdomains of the given domains list.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

It needs the below packages to be in your system setup. Note:- You need to install subfinder explicitly. 

```
Subfinder
certifi
chardet
idna
python-nmap
requests
urllib3
```

### Installing and Usage

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the project running:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 endpoint_finder.py -p <target file>
```

where "target file" is the file containing all the domains.

## Deployment

To quickly run the docker image, run the below command: 
```
docker run -it --rm --name MEF -v /targets.txt:/targets.txt logicbomb1/docker-eef:latest python3 endpoint_finder.py -p targets.txt
```

where targets.txt is the file containing all the domains.
